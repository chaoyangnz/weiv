# weiv
weiv.js - A home-brew UI view library for modern component web development

# What is weiv

Weiv is the reverse of View.

# Why weiv?

This is an era of evolution with tons of front-end frameworks: React, Angular, Vue, Preact, Ractive, Svelte. Probably like me, you also feel tired to follow this one or another one. So I choose to reinvent the wheel and eat my own dog food.
